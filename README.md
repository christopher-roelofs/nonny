Description
-----------

Play and create nonogram puzzles! Nonograms (also known as Griddlers
or Picross) are logic puzzles in which numeric clues are used to fill
in squares within a grid in order to reveal a picture.

What Is a Nonogram?
-------------------

Nonograms are logic puzzles originating from Japan. You start with a
blank grid and then fill in the cells according to the clue numbers at
the sides. When you finish the puzzle, you're left with a picture to
look at:

For example, a clue of "4" means that you need to fill in four
consecutive blocks somewhere within that line. By considering the
different possible positions you can determine that some of the cells
in the line must be filled:

![Line solving - 4](media/tutorial/clue.png)

Similarly, a clue of "1 2" means that one cell is to be filled,
followed by a gap of at least one blank cell, followed by two
consecutive filled cells:

By working line by line in this way, you can solve most
puzzles. Harder puzzles may require more advanced techniques, but
well-made puzzles should not require guessing.

There are also multicolor puzzles. These puzzles work the same way,
but each clue number is colored to indicate which color the cells must
be painted. Adjacent blocks of cells of different colors need not have
a gap between them.


Development Status
------------------

Nonny is playable but not yet ready for an initial release. Most of
the basic functionality for playing and editing puzzles has been
implemented. However, the built-in solver/analysis tool is still being
developed, and there are other minor features that are still missing.

At the moment, Nonny only supports two file formats: [Steven Simpson's
.non format](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~simpsons/nonogram/) (extended
for multicolor support) and the .g format used by [Mirek Ol코치k and
Petr Ol코치k's nonogram
solver](http://www.olsak.net/grid.html#English). Many other popular
formats will be supported in the future.


Installation
------------

Windows binaries will eventually be provided. For now the only way to
install Nonny is to build the game yourself.

To build Nonny, you'll need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.1 or later,
[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/),
[SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), and
[SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/).

GNU/Linux build and install example:
```
git clone https://github.com/gkikola/nonny.git
cd nonny
mkdir build
cd build
