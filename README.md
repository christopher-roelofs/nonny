Description
-----------

Play and create nonogram puzzles! Nonograms (also known as Griddlers
or Picross) are logic puzzles in which numeric clues are used to fill
in squares within a grid in order to reveal a picture.

Development Status
------------------

Nonny is playable but not yet ready for an initial release. Most of
the basic functionality for playing and editing puzzles has been
implemented, but it's still very much a work in progress.

At the moment, Nonny only supports two file formats: [Steven Simpson's
.non format](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~simpsons/nonogram/) (extended
for multicolor support) and the .g format used by [Mirek Ol코치k and
Petr Ol코치k's nonogram
solver](http://www.olsak.net/grid.html#English). Many other popular
formats will be supported in the future.


Installation
------------

Windows binaries will eventually be provided. For now the only way to
install Nonny is to build the game yourself.

To build Nonny, you'll need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.1 or later,
[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/),
[SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), and
[SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/).

GNU/Linux build and install example:
```
git clone https://github.com/gkikola/nonny.git
cd nonny
mkdir build
cd build
