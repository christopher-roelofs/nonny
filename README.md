Description
-----------

Nonny lets you play and create nonogram puzzles! Nonograms (also known
as Griddlers, Picross, and Paint-by-Number) are logic puzzles played
on a grid of squares. The squares are filled in or left blank
according to numeric clues at the sides of the grid. When the puzzle
is finished, the filled-in squares form a picture.

Nonny comes packaged with a selection of puzzles for you to play, and
you can easily import puzzles from other sources. Nonny also allows
you to create your own puzzles. There is a built-in solver which can
be used to verify that your puzzles have only one solution.

Nonny tracks your completion status and times for each puzzle, and you
may save your progress on a puzzle and resume solving it at a later
time.

What Is a Nonogram?
-------------------

Nonograms are logic puzzles originating from Japan. You start with a
blank grid and then fill in the cells according to the clue numbers at
the sides. When you finish the puzzle, you're left with a picture to
look at:

![Solving a puzzle](media/tutorial/solving.png)

For example, a clue of "4" means that you need to fill in four
consecutive blocks somewhere within that line. By considering the
different possible positions you can determine that some of the cells
in the line must be filled:

![Line solving - 4](media/tutorial/clue.png)

Similarly, a clue of "1 2" means that one cell is to be filled,
followed by a gap of at least one blank cell, followed by two
consecutive filled cells:

![Line solving - 1 2](media/tutorial/clue2.png)

By working line by line in this way, you can solve most
puzzles. Harder puzzles may require more advanced techniques, but
well-made puzzles should not require guessing.

Nonny also supports multicolor puzzles. These puzzles work the same way,
but each clue number is colored to indicate which color the cells must
be painted:

Adjacent blocks of cells of different colors need not have a gap
between them. For example, a blue 2 followed by a red 2 means that
there are two consecutive blue cells, possibly but not necessarily
followed by a gap, followed by two consecutive red cells:

Again, by considering the different possibilities you can find cells
that must be filled in, which gives you more information to solve the
other lines in the puzzle.


Development Status
------------------

Nonny should be ready for its initial, preliminary release within the
next several days, probably on or before June 16th, 2017. Windows
binaries will be provided then.
