Description
-----------

Nonny lets you play and create nonogram puzzles! Nonograms (also known
as Griddlers, Picross, and Paint-by-Number) are logic puzzles played
on a grid of squares. The squares are filled in or left blank
according to numeric clues at the sides of the grid. When the puzzle
is finished, the filled-in squares form a picture.

Nonny comes packaged with a selection of puzzles for you to play, and
you can easily import puzzles from other sources. Nonny also allows
you to create your own puzzles. There is a built-in solver which can
be used to verify that your puzzles have only one solution.

Nonny tracks your completion status and times for each puzzle, and you
may save your progress on a puzzle and resume solving it at a later
time.

What Is a Nonogram?
-------------------

Nonograms are logic puzzles originating from Japan. You start with a
blank grid and then fill in the cells according to the clue numbers at
the sides. When you finish the puzzle, you're left with a picture to
look at:

![Solving a puzzle](media/tutorial/solving.png)

For example, a clue of "4" means that you need to fill in four
consecutive blocks somewhere within that line. By considering the
different possible positions you can determine that some of the cells
in the line must be filled:

![Line solving - 4](media/tutorial/clue.png)

Similarly, a clue of "1 2" means that one cell is to be filled,
followed by a gap of at least one blank cell, followed by two
consecutive filled cells:

![Line solving - 1 2](media/tutorial/clue2.png)

By working line by line in this way, you can solve most
puzzles. Harder puzzles may require more advanced techniques, but
well-made puzzles should not require guessing.

Nonny also supports multicolor puzzles. These puzzles work the same way,
but each clue number is colored to indicate which color the cells must
be painted:

![Multicolor puzzle](media/tutorial/color_solving.png)

Adjacent blocks of cells of different colors need not have a gap
between them. For example, a blue 2 followed by a red 2 means that
there are two consecutive blue cells, possibly but not necessarily
followed by a gap, followed by two consecutive red cells:

Again, by considering the different possibilities you can find cells
that must be filled in, which gives you more information to solve the
other lines in the puzzle.


Development Status
------------------

Nonny is functional and has a reasonable set of features but needs
some optimization and some polish. Other goals for the near future
include support for more file formats, better efficiency in the
solver, and command-line arguments for easy puzzle loading and
solving.

Additional planned features include the ability to save and load
puzzle states while solving so that guesses can be easily made or
reverted, and a better clue display that makes it easier to see clues
for the current row and column when working on large puzzles.


Installation
------------

**From binary (currently Windows only):**

Download the latest `nonny-x.x_w32.zip` archive and extract its
contents anywhere. You can then run Nonny by running `nonny.exe`.


**From source:**

You'll need to have several things installed. First you'll need
general development tools: a C++ compiler (the one provided by the
[GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) works well), essential
binary utilities as provided by [GNU
binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) or your system's
equivalent, a shell from which to run commands, and basic command line
tools for working with directories. On
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-based systems, you can get these by
installing the `build-essential` package.

Next, you'll need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.1 or later, and the
following libraries: [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/),
[SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), and
[SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/). Make sure you
have the development headers for these libraries installed. On
Debian-based systems you can simply install the packages `cmake`,
`libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-image-dev`, and `libsdl2-ttf-dev`.

To build Nonny, first download and extract the source archive, or (if
you have `git` installed) clone the repository with
```
git clone https://github.com/gkikola/nonny.git
```

Then from the main project directory (the one that contains the
`CMakeLists.txt` file), run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
This should create the input files for your platform's native build
system. On Unix-like systems this will usually be in the form of
makefiles. You can then run `make` to build the game and then `sudo
make install` to install it (installing is not necessary, you can run
the game from its `build` directory). On Windows you can use CMake to
generate a Visual Studio solution, which you can then open and build
within Visual Studio. It should also be possible to build and run
Nonny on macOS or OS X but this has not yet been tested.
